I used Startup_profit_prediction dataset to predict the profit relationship with administration cost, marketing spend and R&D Spend.

The outputs of the prediction are independent of cities. It is shown by using graphs.


Each row in the dataset represents one startup and includes the following information:

R&D Spend: Money spent on research and development
Administration: Money spent on admin work like salaries, office costs, etc.
Marketing Spend: Money spent on advertising and promotions
State: The location of the startup (e.g., California, Florida)
Profit: The actual profit made by the startup.

This kind of dataset is often included in beginner-level machine learning exercises, especially for learning linear regression. It‚Äôs small, easy to understand, and good for testing simple models.

Here are **clear, simple instructions** on how to run your Streamlit-based app, either locally or online:

---

## üîß How to Run the App

### üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: Run the App on Your Local Machine

#### Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

If you haven't already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivani3333/startup_profit_prediction_model.git
cd startup_profit_prediction_model
```

#### Step 2: (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

This keeps your Python packages separate from other projects:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

#### Step 3: Install Required Python Packages

Make sure you‚Äôre in the same folder as `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

After a few seconds, your browser will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üåê Option 2: Run the App Online (Streamlit Cloud)

If you've already deployed the app, you can use the public URL.

1. Visit:
   **[https://shivani3333-startup-profit-prediction-model.streamlit.app]((https://startupprofitpredictionmodel-abcxyz.streamlit.app/))**

2. Use the input fields to enter:

   * R\&D Spend
   * Administration
   * Marketing Spend

3. Click the **Predict** button to see the estimated profit.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need

* Python installed (3.7 or higher recommended)
* Internet connection (for installation or deployment)
* Your model file (`model.pkl`) should be in the same folder as `app.py`

Let me know if you'd like this added to your `README.md` or as a separate markdown file like `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
